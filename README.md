# TubbsReddit
**Work in Progress**

This is an Android App that I've worked on in my spare time. I still have ALOT of work to do to it but essentially
it is going to be a Reddit viewer that is able to peruse subreddits. This is my first real native Android app so there's
a ton of crappy code. If you find a mistake, or a better way of doing things, please by all means help me out!

I will one day finish it. :)
